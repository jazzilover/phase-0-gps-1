# gps1.1 reflection
* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?   I was struggling with the pull & the merge.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS? The pull and the merge where both clarified.
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked my pair on the struction of the merge and I asked the guide on the use of the pull.
* What still confuses you about Git? I'm still a little confused on the merge conflict.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? The 1st pairing was fun and tedious at the same time.
